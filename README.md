# Language_Translator_to_C
This project was my 1st Homework for the course CMPE 230 (Systems Programming) at Bogazici University. Our task was: Given a language designed by our instructor, implementation of the BNF of the language using recursion, checking syntax using BNF / grammar rules and the translation of the given language code to C language code.
